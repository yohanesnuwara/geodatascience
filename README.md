My finished and unfinished projects on multiple geo-datasets (mostly public dataset; unless, stated otherwise), including:

* Visualization & statistical analysis of 🍏:
    * Realtime drilling data (WITSML XML format)
    * Realtime trajectory data (WITSML XML format)
    * LWD-MWD (DLIS format)
    * Mud log data (unstructured XML format)
* Prediction of ... using machine learning 🍏:
    * Realtime near-wellbore lithology from above integrated data
    * Dips from fracture data + Ecoscope LWD logs
* Seismic data 🍊:
   * Amplitude extraction from 3D seismic volume on formation top in Gullfaks data
   * Co-kriging porosity from amplitude data
   * Co-kriging depth map from TWT map
* Poroperm workflows 🍊:
   *  Variogram modeling of spatial poroperm distribution
   *  Reservoir heterogeneity calculation from poroperm logs
   *  Co-kriging permeability from porosity data
* Production data analysis 🍏
* Image log data (TIFF converted from PDS format) 🍏
* Exploratory data analysis of permeability database from 1,240 wells in the North Sea 🍇  

Data source:
🍏 Volve data village (Equinor)
🍊 Gullfaks
🍇 Geoprovider AS (Norway)
