My finished and unfinished projects on multiple geo-datasets (mostly public dataset, stated otherwise), including:

* Visualization of:
    * Realtime drilling data (WITSML)
    * Realtime trajectory data
    * LWD-MWD
    * Mud log data
* Prediction of ... using machine learning:
    * Realtime near-wellbore lithology from above integrated data
    * Dips from fracture data + Ecoscope LWD logs
* Image log data
